# PodcastFeedHandler
A Java library to read and write podcast feeds. This library took a lot of inspiration from [MarkusLewis - Podcast Feed Library](https://github.com/MarkusLewis/Podcast-Feed-Library). They made a great library, but I wanted to be able to create feed, as well as read them; their library was very good for reading, but would need a lot of work to make it a writing library.

## Key Features
* Reading/Writing Podcast feeds, reading local files and remote
* Java 11+ compatible
* No dependencies, 100% self contained and native code

## Progress
Writing working, need to test. In reading then writing we seem to be stripping the CDATA[] wrapper.
